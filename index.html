                <h1>Rocket Rescue</h1>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <div class="basic">Rocket Rescue is a 2D platformer where the player must avoid environmental
                    obsticales while traversing a foreign planet to get to their ship. The 
                    planet is much more hostile than Earth, with acid rain, acid puddles,
                    and falling rubble. The player must navigate these obsticales and learn
                    how to survive to make it to their rocket.
                </div>
                <h2>How I Made It</h2>
                <div class="basic">To make Rocket Rescue, I used Unity. I made all the art myself using
                    Procreate. This project was made in 72 hours for a Hackathon I 
                    participated in. To see the code, click the link to my <a href="https://github.com/kaitlynkilner/Rocket-Rescue">
